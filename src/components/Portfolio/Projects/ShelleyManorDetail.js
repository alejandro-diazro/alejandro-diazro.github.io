                    Find your way through a puzzle-filled manor while barely dodging human eating monsters. You wake up
                    in a dark room with one main objective: escape those sharpened teeth. However you shall not worry,
                    you will meet friends along the way.

                <h2>My Rol in this Project</h2>
                <p>My primary task in this project was related to the interface, including the implementation of systems
                    connected to it, such as the inventory system and the map system, as well as the development of all
                    the menus. I also handled the implementation of sound and provided support to the other programmers
                    with their remaining tasks.
