                    A VR game based on motion sensors, inspired by Super Hot, made with the Unity engine. This project
                    was developed by <a href={"https://www.linkedin.com/in/joel-vinaroz-gim%C3%A9nez-474b3a2b8/"}>Joel
                    Vinaroz</a>, <a
                    href={"https://www.linkedin.com/in/enrique-tarin-12436a222/"}>Enrique
                    Tarin</a> and myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We drew inspiration from the unique gameplay mechanics of Super Hot to craft an immersive VR
                    experience, where time only moves forward when the player moves. The use of motion sensors adds an
                    extra layer of interactivity, allowing players to physically dodge bullets and strategize their
                    movements with precision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main goal of our project is to deliver an exciting and immersive experience that fully leverages
                    the capabilities of virtual reality and motion sensors. We hope players will enjoy the combination
                    of strategic action and physical movement we offer in our game.

                <p>
                    In this project, I focused on developing the foundational AI systems, designing and implementing the
