                    HiCrew! is a web application crafted for virtual airlines operating within the IVAO network.
                    Designed to streamline pilot management and flight tracking, it integrates seamlessly with IVAO's
                    Single Sign-On (SSO) system and offers a lightweight, ACARS-free solution for logging flights.

                    and an intuitive interface, all built to enhance the experience of virtual airline members.
