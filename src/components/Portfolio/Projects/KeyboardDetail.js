                    A multiplayer game made with the Unity engine, made as part of the HND design course in Computer
                    Science. The goal was to make a game with a unique input method: using the whole keyboard, using
                    more than 30 keys. This project was developed by my partner <a href={"https://www.linkedin.com/in/enrique-tarin-12436a222/"}>Enrique Tarin</a> and me.

                    This project helped me to deepen my knowledge on how to develop an online game in Unity using Unity Gaming Services, focusing specifically on its replay system. In addition to the online system, the game features a single-player mode with several minigames.

                <h2>My Rol in this Project</h2>
                <p>In this project, I handled all the UI/UX design and implementation, developed the game options system, implemented the online multiplayer system using Unity Gaming Services, created the dialogue system, and built the lazer game minigame. Additionally, I modeled all the 3D assets visible in the game.
