                    Archery Scorer is a mobile-first web application designed to simplify archery scoring. Built with a
                    focus on usability, it leverages the browser's local cache for data storage, eliminating the need
                    for a backend while ensuring a seamless experience for archers on the go.

                    capabilities, and sharing functionality, all tailored for mobile use.
